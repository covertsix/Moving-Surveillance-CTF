# Moving Surveillance CTF
Want to learn something while not in front of a screen at DEFCON this summer? Join us for a cat and mouse moving surveillance exercise.

### Description
My extremely unofficial Moving Surveillance CTF will be held on the morning of August 10th.
Sandwiched beautifully between BSides Las Vegas and DEFCON, this is going to be a great opportunity to collaborate, learn, and develop your moving surveillance skills with other like-minded individuals. Also, it's your chance to take a much needed screen time break!

This event is open to anyone, regardless of experience level. No idea what you're doing? That's fine! Think you're an elite red teamer? Show us what you've got!

# AGENDA
_August 10, 2023, 10am - 2pm (In the vicinity of Caesars Forum)_

### Surveillance Round 1: 10-11am
This will be a cold start. None of the team will have met yet, and this round will be used to see what you’ve got. That's right, you won't know who any of your other team members are so this is going to be a challenge. It also has to the potential to be a comedic exercise. Regardless of how round 1 goes, take it as a learning experience and try not to get frustrated. ** CTF points are not awarded during round 1 **

### Round 1 Debrief: 11-11:30am
Time to learn! We'll debrief round 1 as a team, and discuss how we can do better based on round 1 and any real world experience we bring to the table. This is where we'll share and learn as much as we can about what worked, what didn’t, and how we can better work as a team. Questions, questions, questions!

### Surveillance Round 2: 11:30-1pm
You'll know your surveillance team members in round 2, however your rabbit will also know you so adjust accordingly. Difficulty will be fluid based on round 1 success, and all CTF points will be awarded in this round.

# FAQ
- **Is the target/rabbit aware that they're under watch?** Yes, the target is aware that they are under watch, however they don't know who any of the surveillance team members are.
- **Is the surveillance team supposed to avoid detection?** Avoiding detection is a big part of it. The rabbit won't know anything about you in round 1, however in round 2 they will so you'll have to adjust your presence accordingly.
- **What are the flags?** Flags won't be published prior to the event. This is so there isn't going to be any obstructive "one upping" of other members of the team. The goal is to relay valuable intelligence, rather than continuous spewing.
- **Really? No tips for the flags?** Fine. You're going to be going after: listening, observing, planning, documenting and stealth.
- **Can we plant bugs?** Yes, but only on the target. Physical locations are not to be bugged. In a real world scenario physical locations would be ok, but this is Vegas and we will surely get in trouble for doing so. So once again, ONLY ON THE TARGET & NOWHERE ELSE.
- **How will we communicate?** Audio only via a group chat set up by the organizer.
- **Will we know anything about the target beforehand?** No, you won't any won't be able to conduct any kind of OSINT on the target before, during, or after the event.
- **What is the maximum number of participants?** 7. Less works, but 7 is the maximum. First come first served.
- **Do I need any experience** No. Regardless of experience level, anyone is welcome to join!
